# Clarity Trait Experiments

This repo contains a set of experiments to see how traits work.

To run the experiments, you need:

-   the Blockstacks Clarity `clarity-cli` command available on your `PATH`
-   to run `bash run-tests.sh`

The file `run-tests.sh` contains all of the trait experiments with commentary about what is being tested.
